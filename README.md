# IoT-Intern

Log of my internship with Professor Wenyao Xu at U Buffalo (SUNY).

Finger veins are unique to the individual and provide more security than finger prints
As a research intern for Prof Wenyao Xu at SUNY UBuffalo,
I investigated the applications of finger veins in the Internet or Things.
I programmed a Local Linear Binary Pattern approach to extract such veins
and fed this into a variety of common ML models. Also applied similar techniques on
retina veins and medical CT scans of the chest to classify pneumonia.

Check out some results in the [/results folder](/results)!
